firstly, and more importantly fresh and flavoured pav bhaji masala is very crucial to this recipe. basically, it is the heart and soul of this dish and hence never compromise on the quality of it. secondly, you can also extend the recipe by adding other veggies like gobi, carrots, beans and even grated cheddar cheese. in addition, you can totally skip the red food colour which does not add any taste or flavour to this recipe. lastly, i would heavily recommend serving the pav fried in butter and bit of bhaji. this would enhance the flavour of ordinary pav.
